Let's do roman numerals for footnote markers, shall we?

.
Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]

[^1]: Here is the footnote.

[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
belong to the previous footnote.

        { some.code }

    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
    line.  In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like
    multi-paragraph list items.

This paragraph won't be part of the note, because it
isn't indented.

Here is an inline note that's turned endnote^[:Inline notes are easier to write, since
you don't have to pick an identifier and move down to type the
note.]

Note these *bunched together footnote references*[^a1][^a2][^a3][^a4][^a5][^a6][^a7][^a8][^a9][^a10][^a11][^a12]. There's a bit of extra HTML (and some CSS required) to help style such *bunches*! Also note `options.refCombiner` for this.

[^a1]: foo
[^a2]: foo
[^a3]: foo
[^a4]: foo
[^a5]: foo
[^a6]: foo
[^a7]: foo
[^a8]: foo
[^a9]: foo
[^a10]: foo
[^a11]: foo
[^a12]: foo
