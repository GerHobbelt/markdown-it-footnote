And then here's a big example where we expect **multiple sections** filled with footnotes, at the spot where they have been defined!

Meanhwile, **inline footnotes** should produce an ASIDE at the end of the active paragraph!

# Testing 1

## Sub heading 2

How to style this using classical CSS?

Example:

```css
li.footnote-item {
    list-style-type: none;
    /* position:  relative; */
}
span.footnote-caption {
    /* position: absolute; */
    float:  left;
    margin-left:  -1em;
}
```


### Subsub heading 2.1

Some even nicer text


### Subsub heading 2.2

Some even nicer text

Here is an inline footnote reference^[:the `(B)` way you might imagine, we got fruitcakes all around Santa Monica] for every one of us.

Plus an aside^[>that `(A)` should be plugged in right at the end of this paragraph!] for every one of us.

Avec du blah blah surplus pour les experiments...

## Sub heading 3

Some even nicer text


## Sub heading 4

Some even nicer text


# Testing 2

## Footnotes Exemplified...

Here is a footnote reference[^1], and another[^longnote].

[^1]: Here `(C)` is the footnote.

[^longnote]: Here's `(D)` one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
belong to the previous footnote.

        { some.code }

    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
    line.  In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like
    multi-paragraph list items.

This paragraph won't be part of the note, because it
isn't indented.

# Testing 3

## Footnotes Galore

Here is a footnote reference[^2], and another[^3].

[^2]:> Here `(E)` is the 2nd footnote.

[^3]: Here `(F)` is the 3rd footnote.

## Sub heading 3

Some even nicer text with *nested* inline footnotes A^[`(G)` nested^[into `(H)` the deep^[that's `(I)` closer to a black hole^[getting `(J)` scientific, are we now?] of footnote **depth**^[one `(K)` wonders how many *fathom* this would be, then...] ravine.] end near a rabbit hole.] horrors abound. Chtulhu footnote style?] & Alice.

### Footnotes Galore

Here is a footnote reference[^x], and another[^y]. **Note that the footnotes all have a letter in braces, e.g. `(B)`, to denote their *expected* order in the final output. This is done to ease visual (manual) inspection and debugging while testing the (*insanely*) nested footnotes.**


[^x]: Here `(L)` is the X footnote. With a footnote[^z] nested in itself^[it `(M)` can get complicated[^sure] if you are not careful!] and of itself. Yada.

[^z]: that's `(N)` what *he*[^y] said.

[^sure LBL]: Can `(O)` I interest you in bridge for sale? 

    This one comes cheap, one careful owner. Satisfaction guaranteed!

[^y]: Here `(P)` is the Y footnote. And a bit[^2] of cross[^3] fertilization[^sure]. We even have a cycle[^x]!
