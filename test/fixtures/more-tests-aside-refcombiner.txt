Pandoc example:
.
Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]

[^1]: Here is the footnote.

[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
belong to the previous footnote.

        { some.code }

    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
    line.  In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like
    multi-paragraph list items.

This paragraph won't be part of the note, because it
isn't indented.

This paragraph won't be part of the note neither, because it
isn't indented.
.
<p>Here is a footnote reference,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> and another.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>This paragraph won't be part of the note, because it
isn't indented.</p>
<p>This paragraph won't be part of the note neither, because it
isn't indented.</p>
<hr class="footnotes-sep">
<section class="footnotes">
<ol class="footnotes-list">
<li tabindex="-1" id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>Here is the footnote. <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li tabindex="-1" id="fn2" class="footnote-item"><p>Here's one with multiple blocks.</p>
<p>Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
belong to the previous footnote.</p>
<pre><code>{ some.code }
</code></pre>
<p>The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
line.  In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like
multi-paragraph list items. <a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
</section>

We support inline notes too as ASIDE blocks after the active paragraph:

.
Here is an inline note.^[Inlines notes are easier to write, since
you don't have to pick an identifier and move down to type the
note.]

Followed by yet another paragraph of regular text.
.
xxx
.




Duplicate footnotes:

.
Note [^xxxxx].

Also note [^xxxxx]

[^xxxxx]: foo

Tail A.

Tail B.
.
xxx
.


Now what should happen when a footnote is referenced AFTER it's been defined? Point back at the EARLIER footnote block, surely!

.
[^xxxxx] [^yyyyy]

[^xxxxx]: foo
    xyz

[^yyyyy]: foo
   abc

Intermission.

Recurring: note[^yyyyy].

And the other dude[^xxxxx] too.
