Pandoc example:
.
Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]

[^1]: Here is the footnote.

[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
belong to the previous footnote.

        { some.code }

    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
    line.  In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like
    multi-paragraph list items.

This paragraph won't be part of the note, because it
isn't indented.

This paragraph won't be part of the note neither, because it
isn't indented.

We support inline notes too as ASIDE blocks after the active paragraph:

.
Here is an inline note.^[Inlines notes are easier to write, since
you don't have to pick an identifier and move down to type the
note.]

Followed by yet another paragraph of regular text.

Duplicate footnotes:

.
Note [^xxxxx].

Also note [^xxxxx]

[^xxxxx]: foo

Tail A.

Tail B.

Now what should happen when a footnote is referenced AFTER it's been defined? Point back at the EARLIER footnote block, surely!

.
[^xxxxx] [^yyyyy]

[^xxxxx]: foo
    xyz

[^yyyyy]: foo
   abc

Intermission.

Recurring: note[^yyyyy].

And the other dude[^xxxxx] too.
